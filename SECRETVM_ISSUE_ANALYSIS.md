# SecretVM Issue Analysis - No Running Containers

## Current Status
Based on your latest log file (`log_file--docker-compose.secretvm-fixed.yml.txt`):

### ✅ What's Working:
- **Image pull successful**: All layers downloaded and extracted
- **No volume mount errors**: Fixed with Docker volumes
- **Docker service operational**: Extraction process completed
- **Network setup completed**: SecretVM network configured properly

### ❓ Issue Identified:
**"Error fetching Docker logs: no running containers found"** - repeated throughout logs

## Root Cause Analysis

### **Most Likely Issue: Architecture Mismatch**
Your SecretVM is running on `qemux86-64` (x86-64 Intel), but the image might have been built for ARM64 (Apple Silicon).

**Evidence:**
- Container pulls successfully but doesn't start
- No explicit error messages about startup failures
- Persistent "no running containers found" messages

### **Secondary Issues:**
1. **User permissions**: `user: "1001:1001"` might not exist in SecretVM
2. **Security constraints**: TEE environment might block certain operations
3. **Resource limitations**: Container might be killed due to memory/CPU limits

## Solutions (In Priority Order)

### **Solution 1: Multi-Architecture Build** ⭐ (Recommended)
Use the build-from-source approach to ensure x86-64 compatibility:

```yaml
# Use docker-compose.secretvm-multiarch.yml
build:
  context: .
  dockerfile: Dockerfile.production-minimal
```

### **Solution 2: Simplified Configuration**
Remove potentially problematic configurations:
- Remove `user: "1001:1001"`
- Simplify health checks
- Reduce resource constraints

### **Solution 3: Debug Container**
Test with a simple container first:

```yaml
services:
  test-container:
    image: alpine:latest
    command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo 'Container running'; sleep 30; done"]
    container_name: secretvm-test
```

## Recommended Next Steps

### **1. Try Multi-Arch Build (Immediate)**
```bash
# Deploy docker-compose.secretvm-multiarch.yml
# This builds the image on SecretVM's x86-64 architecture
```

### **2. If Build Fails - Use Debug Container**
```yaml
# Simple test to verify basic container functionality
services:
  debug:
    image: ubuntu:22.04
    command: ["bash", "-c", "apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && while true; do echo 'Debug container running'; curl -s http://httpbin.org/get || echo 'Network test failed'; sleep 60; done"]
    container_name: secretvm-debug
```

### **3. Monitor Specific Logs**
After deployment, check:
- Container creation logs
- Container startup logs
- Resource usage
- Network connectivity

## Files Provided

1. **`docker-compose.secretvm-multiarch.yml`** - Multi-architecture build approach
2. **This analysis document**

## What to Expect

### **If Architecture Issue:**
- Multi-arch build should resolve the startup problem
- Container will build native x86-64 binaries
- Should see successful container startup logs

### **If Other Issues:**
- Build logs will show specific errors
- Can troubleshoot step-by-step from build failures

## Next Action

**Deploy `docker-compose.secretvm-multiarch.yml`** and monitor the build process. This will build the container on the SecretVM's native x86-64 architecture, which should resolve the startup issue.
